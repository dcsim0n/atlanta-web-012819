# TaskLister Lite™️

## Hello and Welcome to TaskLister Lite™️

Today you'll be creating a simple to do list application that will focus on DOM manipulation. Take a look at `index.html` and identify the DOM elements you'll need to manipulate before you write any code.

Check out the [working demo][example]


### Solution Thought Process

Step 1. What elements on my page should have listeners attached? 
	-select elements
	-attach listeners using addEventListener
	-be sure to attach callbacks

Step 2. What functionality is this event triggering? I.e. What do my callbacks need to do? 
	(This step will vary depending on what you are trying to accomplish
	and requires some problem solving)
	-Most likely I am changing my view (index.html) via the DOM
	-Getting the data I need from the event (e.target?)
	-Creating elements using the data as content
	-Selecting the right part of my page to change (querySelector?)
	-Appending new elements to my page
